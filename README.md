# eBallot Voting System

A fully-fledged secure voting application that features facial recognition and ID match is designed to provide a secure and reliable platform for voting without the need for registration. The application is connected to the government ID database to verify the identity of the voters before they cast their votes.

The first step in the voting process is to verify the identity of the voter. The application uses facial recognition technology to match the image of the voter with the image on the government-issued ID card. This ensures that the voter is who they claim to be and prevents fraudulent voting.

Once the voter's identity is verified, the application allows them to cast their vote. The voter can select their preferred candidate or vote on a particular issue, and the application will record their vote securely.

To ensure the confidentiality of the voting process, the application encrypts the votes and stores them in a secure database. The database is only accessible to authorized personnel, and any attempt to tamper with the data will trigger an alarm.

The application also features a real-time monitoring system that allows election officials to monitor the voting process and identify any irregularities. The system can detect any attempts to hack or manipulate the voting process and alert officials to take necessary action.

In conclusion, a fully-fledged secure voting application that features facial recognition and ID match is an ideal solution for a secure and reliable voting process. The application's integration with the government ID database eliminates the need for voter registration, making the voting process more accessible and convenient for voters.
